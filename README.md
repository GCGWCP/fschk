# Schange
See what's changed in your file system.

This is so far from a prototype you shouldn't even be reading this.



### Installation

You need to install postgres, and still have to create the database manually.

```
git clone https://github.com/knotech/schange.git
cd schange/
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python fschk.py
```
